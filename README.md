# SARS-CoV-2

In this repository I have uploaded some files containing raw genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2, aligned sequences (using MAFFT), NEXUS files of aligned sequences, phylogenetic trees (made with PAUP*), R scripts for own multiple sequence alignment and/or distance-based methods and the like. I'll be updating this repository as much as I can.
